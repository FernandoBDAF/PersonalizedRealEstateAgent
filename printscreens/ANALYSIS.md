1 - I used the default preferences in the final exercise. I use a high value for the temperature to generate the listing so I
have more randomness

2 - The strategy I used to optimaze was create an enhanced listing description where I converted all numerical properties from
the listings to descriptions using an intermediary value for temparature to avoid the model creating data. I was aiming with 
that have a better result in the vector search.

3 - Comparing the searchs using the raw data (with number + descriptions) and the enhanced data, we can (1) clearly see that
and that they are different and (2) the enhanced data leads to a more ressonante result

4 - The LLM Aumented transform the raw data so it was more appeling to the buyer
